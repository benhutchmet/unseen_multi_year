    "CANARI HIST2 consists of a large ensemble of historical HadGEM3-GC31 runs between 1950-2014, with 40 members. The following variables are available:\n",

    "* Daily temperature (for demand conversion)\n",

    "The temperature -> demand conversion is relatively simple. Convert to HDD/CDD and then use the regression relationships.\n",

    "The 10m wind speed to wind power generation is more involved. Convert 10m wind speed to 100m wind speed through a power law conversion."
