    "1. Worst wind cold temp events - for each winter, this is where I've selected the day with the lowest wind speed and taken the corresponding temperature on that 'worst wind' day. I have then plotted these as a scatter and identified the very bad days, which are in both the 0th-50th percentile of the wind speeds for worst wind days and 0th-50th percentile of temperature for the worst temp days. These very bad days are what I am plotting as composites here.\n",
